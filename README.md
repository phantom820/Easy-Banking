# Easy-Banking
A dummy mobile banking application that aims to provide users with an easy,reliable and convenient banking experience. Users open their preferred account type 
upon registration and synthetic transactions are generated along with other user account details. The main idea is to digitize the entire banking experience although
the banking has shifted towards digitization some key aspects have remained unchanged such as the opening/closing of accounts, filing of notice for 
notice deposit accounts. The listed aspects still require individuals to physically go to a bank which is not ideal.
